	When created, this DLL does not export any symbols. As a result, it  
	will not produce a .lib file when it is built. If you wish this project 
	to be a project dependency of some other project, you will either need to 
	add code to export some symbols from the DLL so that an export library 
	will be produced, or you can set the Ignore Input Library property to Yes 
	on the General propert page of the Linker folder in the project's Property 
	Pages dialog box.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

[!output PROJECT_NAME].rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.
[!endif]
[!if WIN_APP]

[!output SAFE_PROJECT_NAME].ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file [!output PROJECT_NAME].rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file [!output PROJECT_NAME].rc.
[!endif]

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named [!output PROJECT_NAME].pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp

[!if SUPPORT_MFC]
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The compiler and linker switches have been modified to support MFC. Using the
MFC ClassWizard with this project requires that you add several files to the 
project, including "resource.h", "[!output PROJECT_NAME].rc" and a "[!output PROJECT_NAME].h" that 
includes resource.h. If you add an rc file to a static library, you may 
experience difficulties due to the limitation that only one rc file may be 
present in a Dll or Exe. This problem may be overcome by including the 
library's .rc file into the parent project's .rc file.
